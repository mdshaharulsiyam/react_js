         <h2 className='my-5'>The Mediterranean Diet: A Healthful Lifestyle</h2>
         <p className='font-normal text-sm'>One of the hallmarks of Mediterranean cuisine is its promotion of a balanced and heart-healthy diet. Olive oil, a cornerstone of Mediterranean cooking, is rich in monounsaturated fats that are beneficial for cardiovascular health. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and a moderate intake of wine are key components of this diet, making it not just delicious but also nutritious.</p>

         <p className='font-normal text-sm'>Each region along the Mediterranean Sea has its own unique culinary traditions. In Greece, you'll find moussaka, a layered dish of eggplant, ground meat, and béchamel sauce, while Spain boasts the famous paella, a saffron-infused rice dish teeming with seafood. Moroccan cuisine features tagine, a slow-cooked stew with tender meats and a blend of exotic spices.

         <h2 className='my-5'>Small Plates, Big Flavor</h2>
         <p className='font-normal text-sm'>One of the most delightful aspects of Mediterranean dining is the concept of "mezze." Mezze consists of an array of small, shareable dishes that allow diners to savor a variety of flavors in one meal. These might include hummus, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, and tzatziki, served with warm pita bread. Mezze is an invitation to explore a range of tastes and textures on a single plate.</p>
